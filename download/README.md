The Gemma models can be downloaded from Google/Kaggle site or from HuggingFace.

The recommendation is to use the huggingface version, it has a couple of advantages:

This has some advantages from downloading it from Google (Kaggle):

- With a HuggingFace token, the process is automatic (no need to manually navigate to the site).

  GoMLX context.
- No Python dependency.
